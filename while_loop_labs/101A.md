# Simple Hang Man

In this lab we will combine some of the fundamentals that we have learned so far including `strings`, `conditionals`, `branching`, `variables`,and `lists`--all while introducing `while` loops. We will be building a simple Hang Man game where we will prompt the user to enter the secret word, the number of guesses for the game, and then enter a loop to play the game. You should structure your program as follows:

- Prompt the user for the secret word
- Prompt the user for the number of guesses allowed in the game
- Begin Game: 
    - While the word hasn't been guessed and the number of guesses is less than the number of guess allowed:
        - Prompt the user for a character
        - Increment the number of guesses
        - Check to see if the guessed character appears in the secret word
            - If the letter appears in the word, print out "Success! You guessed correctly with letter <insert guessed letter here>" (Don't actually print <insert guessed letter here...) But if the secret word has been guessed, only print "Congratulations! You're victorious!"
            - If the letter doesn't appear in the word, print out "Boo! You guessed incorrectly". But if you have ran out of guesses, only print "You ran out of guesses, better luck next time!"
        - Print out the secret word with any of the guessed letters in the location that they appear in the word.
