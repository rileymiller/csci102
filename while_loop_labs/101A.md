# Simple Hang Man

In this lab we will combine some of the fundamentals that we have learned so far including `strings`, `conditionals`, `branching`, `variables`,and `lists`--all while introducing `while` loops. We will be building a simple Hang Man game where we will prompt the user to enter the secret word, the number of guesses for the game, and then enter a loop to play the game. You should structure your program as follows:

- Prompt the user for the secret word
- Prompt the user for the number of guesses allowed in the game
- Begin Game: 
    - While the word hasn't been guessed and the number of guesses is less than the number of guess allowed:
        - Prompt the user for a character
        - Increment the number of guesses
        - Check to see if the guessed character appears in the secret word
            - If the character appears in the word, print out "Success! You guessed correctly with character \[insert guessed character here\]" (Don't actually print \[insert guessed character here\]...) But if the secret word has been guessed, only print "Congratulations! You guessed the secret word!", print the secret word on a new line, then end the game
            - If the character doesn't appear in the word, print out "Boo! You guessed incorrectly". But if you have ran out of guesses, only print "You ran out of guesses, better luck next time!", print out the secret word on a new line, then end the game
            - Hint: When a character is discovered in the secret word, consider replacing it in the secret word with an uncommonly used character like `#,$,^, or @`, and then having another variable for the letters in the secret word that have already been guessed. This will help in instances when a character appears in a word more than once.
        - Print out the number of guesses remaining
        - Print out the characters that have been guessed already
        - Print out the secret word with any of the guessed character in the location that they appear in the word
