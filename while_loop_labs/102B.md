# Guess the Number

In this lab we will be introducing `while` loops in a game where we will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 and keep asking them to guess until they get it right. You should structure your program as follows:

- Generate a random number between using 1 and 100 that the user will be trying to guess

    ```
    import random

    random.randint(1,101)
    ```
- Ask the user to guess a number:
    - If the number is greater than 100, ask the user to input a number between 1 and 100
    - If the number is less than 1, ask the user to input a number between 1 and 100
    - If the number is greater than 50 away from the randomly generated number, print out "You're getting colder!"
    - If the number is greater than 25 and less than 50 away from the randomly generated number, print out "You're lukewarm!"
    - If the number is greater than 15 and less than 25 away from the randomly generated number, print out "You're getting warm!"
    - If the number is greater than 5 and less than 15 away from the randomly generated number, print out "You're getting hot!"
    - If the number is less than 5 away from the randomly generated number, print out "You're so close!"
    - When the user chooses the correct number, print out "Congrats! You won!"
- Repeat until the user guesses the correct number.

## Sample Execution

```
Enter a number between 1 and 100: 95
You're getting colder!

Enter a number between 1 and 100: 105
Please Enter a number between 1 and 100

Enter a number between 1 and 100: 31
You're lukewarm!

Enter a number between 1 and 100: 22
You're getting warm!

Enter a number between 1 and 100: 16
You're getting hot!

Enter a number between 1 and 100: 9
You're so close!

Enter a number between 1 and 100: 5
Congrats! You won!
```

This lab will be worth *5* points.
