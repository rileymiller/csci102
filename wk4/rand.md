In this program we will be creating a program which will generate a random number and then prompt users to guess the random number.


- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
- Prompt the user to guess the number until they guess right
    - If the number is greater than 100 or less than zero, print out a message that they need to guess a number between 1 and 100.
    - If the number is further than 50 away, output "Getting colder..."
    - If the number is 25 away, output "you're lukewarm"
    - If the number is 15 away, output "you're getting warmer"
    - If the number is 10 away, output "you're getting hot"
    - If the number is 5 away, output "you're so close!!"
    - when the number is guessed, end the game
