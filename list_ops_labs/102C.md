### List palindrome

In this lab we will learn more about lists and list functions by creating palindromnes.

- In a while loop, prompt the user for a character until the user types in '~'.
    - Append the character to the list of inputted characters
    - After adding a character to the list, print out the palindrome of the list in the order that the characters were added.

Example Execution

```
Enter a character: a
OUTPUT> [ 'a', 'a']

Enter a character: b
OUTPUT> [ 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a']

Enter a character: A
OUTPUT> [ 'a', 'b', 'A', 'A', 'b', 'a']
```
