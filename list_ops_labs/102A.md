### Count and Indexes

In this lab we will be learning how to use lists functions. Specifically we will be focusing on index and count.

- Construct a while loop that will run until the user types in '~'
    - In the loop, prompt the user for a character during each iteration.
    - Add each character to a list

- Next we will construct a loop to print information on the list that was previously constructed until the user types in '~'.
- Prompt the user for a character:
    - If the character exists in the list:
        - Print out the number of occurences in the list.
        - Print out the index of each occurence in the list.
        - Print out the complement of the character in the list (the list without the character in it)
        - Then move each occurence of the character in the list to the back of the list and print it out.
