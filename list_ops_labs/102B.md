### Reverse Reverse

In this lab we are going to practice reversing lists.

To begin, populate a 2-D list in a 10 X 10 structure with integers 1-100.

- Next reverse the 2D list such that each list in the 2D list is reversed as well as the order of each list in the outer list.


Example:
```
    [ [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9] ]
                ]
    Reversed:

    [ [9, 8, 7],
      [6, 5, 4],
      [3, 2, 1]
                ]
```

For this lab we will implement our solution two separate ways. The first way you are required to use the `.reverse()` list functions. In the second solution we will manipulate the lists manually without using `.reverse()`.
